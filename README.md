# ChroSearch

ChroSearch was developed as a data parsing solution for non-programmers. It is a standalone program written in VB.NET, and as such only currently runs on Windows. It can take any tab-delimited data file, no matter the size, and quickly extract information for any number of parameters. Each search criteria is based on a column header and allows for text or numerical search to be specified for each column. It then saves the search results in a tab-delimited file. Very basic graphing functionality is also available for quick visualization and spot-checking results. It can search very large files (>10 GB) relatively quickly (~2-3 minutes on most basic laptops). It was the first real piece of code I had ever written, and there are numerous things I would have done differently looking back on it. 

This repository serves primarily as my own personal backup of the project files. 

**Future work:**    
General refactor of code (VB.NET is not very well optimized for big data manipulation).  
Port to C# with Mono for cross-platform development.  
Various cosmetic and UI changes.  
Additional graphing functionality and improvements.
